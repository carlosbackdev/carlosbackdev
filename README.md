Over the past few months, I have been working on a project to create a multi-platform ecosystem using technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript, and MySQL, among others. The final result is a business management software designed for freelancers and small businesses in various trades. This software helps manage projects, invoices, clients, materials, and finances, either through a desktop application or a web application. Additionally, clients can pay their invoices, which are automatically generated and sent to their email from the web application. 💼

**Main technologies used**:
- **Spring Boot**: For the RESTful ➡️ [API](https://github.com/carlosbackdev/ElecIdea-Api-SpringBoot) 🌱
